# Notes in the AI era

Before ChatGPT was released, I used notebook software and blogs to record all the details, such as programming languages, mathematical formulas, and configurations of some software.
But ChatGPT has changed the way we learn; we can now focus on truly important matters, like algorithms, data structures.

So, here I want to keep the notes on some algorithms in wireless communication that are crucial for my daily work.
Another thing to consider is that AI will become a new type of tool, just like the computer or programming laguages, that we must master.

## Things in the notes.
